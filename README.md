## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm proud of solving the `quote__section` and the positioning of the image. It seemed relatively easy but I struggled a few hours to find a solution. 
Also am I really happy to be using the `fb-col-wrapper` more extensively in my projects.
